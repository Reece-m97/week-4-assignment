Reflection

I completed all the basic requirements, and in addition, I implemented form validation. Rather than a simple like button, I introduced a “Haunt” feature to keep with the spooky theme. I chose not to include a delete button, as I want entries to remain, and I haven’t yet learned how to restrict deletions to only the user who created the post.

There was a brief moment of panic when I hit errors trying to push to GitHub, which I later realised was because I’d chosen to work from a cosy coffee shop. Turns out, their Wi-Fi didn’t appreciate my coding session as much as I did!

I also had a few extra ideas for the site that I didn’t get to implement, such as a spooky background with animations and a misty effect, as well as changing the cursor to a skeleton hand when clicking buttons.

Overall, I’m happy with this as an MVP and enjoyed the experience!
